This is simple proof of concept of using ColdFusion and MongoDB.

Conclusion: sweet

Installation:

1. Download and install MongoDB: http://www.mongodb.org/
2. Make sure mongod is running. The examples use MongoDB's defaults:
   server_name = 'localhost', server_port = 27017
3. Download the MongoDB Java Driver: http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver/downloads
4. Place the Java MongoDB Driver in your CF Server's classpath (some /lib somewhere)
5. Copy the CFMongoDB files to your web root; e.g, /cfmongo.
6. Start the server and point your browser to http://localhost:8888/cfmongo/demo.cfm

Notes: This was built and tested on Railo 3.1.1 Express and Ubuntu 9.04. Would like to
test this in other environments.
