h1. CFMongoDB

CFMongoDB is both partial wrapper for the MongoDB Java driver and a document-object mapper for ColdFusion. Additionally, there's a simple DSL which provides ColdFusion developers the ability to easily search MongoDB document collections.

One of the most appealing aspects is that data can be created as a ColdFusion structure and persisted almost verbatim. Example:

<pre>
<cfscript>
col = 'my_collection':
my_struct = {
  foo = 'bar'
  bar = 123
  'tags'=[ 'cool', 'distributed', 'fast' ]
};

mongo.save(my_struct, col);
</cfscript>
</pre>
