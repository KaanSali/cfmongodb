h1. CFMongoDB

CFMongoDB is both partial wrapper for the MongoDB Java driver and a document-object mapper. Additionally, there's a simple DSL which provides ColdFusion developers the ability to easily Mongo documents.

One of the most appealing aspects is that data can be created as a ColdFusion structure and persisted almost verbatir. Example:

<pre>
<cfscript>
my_struct = {
  foo = 'bar'
  bar = 123
};

mongo.save(my_struct);
</cfscript>
</pre>
